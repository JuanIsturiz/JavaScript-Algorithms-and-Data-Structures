# Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Any text/code editor that can handle the Node.js extension (I suggest [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

### How does it work?

1. Open the **javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-certification-projects** folder with your text editor of preference.
2. Select the sub-folder of the program you want to excecute.
3. Open the terminal or an external terminal like the **cmd** from windows.
4. Check if the last location is the folder of the program you want to excecute. if not navigate in the terminal to the folder where the file of preference is located.
5. Run the main.js file with the _node_ command.
